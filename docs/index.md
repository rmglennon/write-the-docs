# My GitHub Pages site

## Basic terminology

You can think of a Git _repository_ as the folder for your project that contains all the component files, such as code, documentation, and examples. You can store your repositories on GitHub, where they can be publicly visible (open source) or be private and only accessible to certain users.

When you start working on a project, you need to make your own _branch_ of a repository, which is a parallel version that contains your changes. As you make modifications, like adding or deleting lines of code or files, you save, or _commit_, your changes.

To propose integrating your commits into the production version of the project, known as the _master branch_, you open a _pull request_. A pull request is the way you start a discussion with others about your changes. Other _collaborators_ on the project can review and approve your work. After your pull request is _merged_, your changes are added to the master branch.

You can review the [GitHub Glossary](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/) to learn more about common terms.

4. Merge files into the master branch.
5. Go to the repository settings and enable GitHub Pages on the master branch.
